Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes.\"\n","\n","**Passage 3:**\n","> \"Water is a macronutrient in the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other macronutrients, it does not yield calories. Water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells.
